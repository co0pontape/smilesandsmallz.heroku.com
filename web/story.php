							This sure goes way back ... We actually crossed paths back in bayside high school. We had a few classes together but never formally met. I remember her sitting in the front and raising her hand to answer questions while I slept in the back of the class. From time to time, I would see her on the same bus to school and of course I always thought she was cute but I wasn’t the type to chase someone. I do remember passing on a message to her from a mutual friend but unfortunately that was the only interaction we've had in high school.

						<p>
							Fast forward to freshman year at Baruch college and I was introduced to her by our good friend, Jennifer Wong (yes ill name my first born Jennifer if it turns out to be a girl that is 6.8 lbs and 14.6 inches long). We all had class together and I looked forward to that class every week *blush*. I will not mention the fact I dressed and groomed myself better on the days we had class together ... Uhhh wait.... After exchanging numbers and AOL sn, we began talking more and more. As the weeks went on and after many IM exchanges, my attraction grew stronger. When the second semester started, I decided to express my feelings to her. To break the ice, I did it through aim.... And what better way to do it than through a subliminal im. I believe the exact im was, "dhfyruihjdehue like djueu you". From what I remember, she said she liked me as well. And now I was 50% from my goal of making her my girlfriend... Within the next few weeks, I gathered enough courage to ask her out in person. On Friday Feb 20, 2001, I asked her to be my girlfriend in front of Barnes & Nobles at Union Square, and the rest is history....

							It really felt like ages ago, and I had to confirm with Andy to be sure I got our story right.
						</p>
						<p>
							Andy and I went to Bayside High School together, but the funny thing was we were never friends. We knew of each other in school, but somehow we only managed to talk once in the four years high school together. I recalled seeing him at the bus stop during our last year of high school quite often, but we’d never even exchanged one word. I would stand by the bus stop waiting for the bus and Andy would be sitting by the bus stop waiting for his friends. This was the same routine for us practically everyday after we got out of class. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Then we started college at Baruch and during our first semester of freshman year, our mutual friend Jennifer (who is also my bridesmaid and one of my best friends) introduced us after Psychology 101 class. The first thing he asked us was for our screen names.  I remembered that same day when I signed onto my computer at home, Andy messaged me on AIM. He turned out to be pretty talkative when he’s behind a computer screen, but had a quiet demure manner in person. 
						</p>
						<p>
							We had a small group of friends who hung out often and studied together during the first semester. By the second semester, some of us only had a few classes together, but Andy and I had every class together. As each day passed, we started to get to know each other more. One day, when we were chatting on AIM, he copied and pasted a chat he had with our mutual friend. It basically said that she saw how Andy looks at me and was pretty certain that he liked me. Good thing this was all on AIM, because I must’ve looked pretty dumbfounded! It never occurred to me that Andy was interested in me in more than a friend.  The next thing I knew, he told me that he liked me, and I didn’t know what to say. I was surprised but happy at the same time and realized maybe I do have feelings for Andy. He’s a genuinely nice guy after all with his cute boyish looks and figured… why not give it a try? 
						</p>						
						<p>
							So one day after class, we went to Barnes & Nobles by Union Square Park and we had to leave the store because I had to head to my next class. Andy stopped me and looked kind of nervous and mumbled something to me. I couldn’t hear the first sentence, and only heard him saying, “No matter what we will always be friends.” For that second, I thought Andy probably had time to think about it and decided maybe it was best to remain friends (I wanted to ask him to repeat it because I couldn’t understand him). But the next thing he mumbled was, “Will you go out with me?” I was slightly confused, but I said “Yes” anyway. I thought this puppy love was going to end in a couple of months (we were just kids), but who knew that 11 ½ years later that I am still very much in love and if not more with the same guy who asked me out many years ago.
