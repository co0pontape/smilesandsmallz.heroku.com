							After 11 and a half years of being together, I decided it was time to get engaged. A lot of you may think wtf took you so long, but in my mind, time was never a factor in getting engaged and married. Our relationship progressed so naturally and effortlessly, I had no doubt in my mind that I would be spending the rest of my life with her from the beginning. It was just a matter of the perfect time to get engaged and married. Since we just bought our first place and started living together for the first time, I figured now was a good time. When our parents kept nagging us about when we would get married, I always responded with a “soon.” At times when we discussed marriage, I assured her we will get married soon, but just not yet.

							In the Beginning of 2012, I decided to do it around her bday in May and a couple of ideas floated through my mind at first. One thing I knew for sure was it would happen where I first asked her out, in front of Barnes & Nobles. Since it was in public, figured I would make it memorable. Recently, we started watching Glee and since she fell in love with the show, it turned her into a complete gleek. With that in mind, I decided I needed to do a sing and dance number. Then the flash mob idea came into mind. I briefly looked at the flash mob America site but it seemed too grand of a proposal. So I figured I could hire a couple of dancers and do my own flash mob proposal. To my surprise I found no hip hop dancers on craigslist, but luckily I remembered i had a childhood friend that break danced. I hit him up on fb, pitched him the idea and he was onboard instantly (thanks Richard Mercado and the supreme beings!). With my ninja skills, I secretly ring shopped, practiced the dance routine (all 10 seconds of it), and planned the day out. I also organized a surprise bday dinner for her near union square with our close friends. I then emailed a few of her close gfs to inform them of my plan to propose before dinner. The only thing I asked them to do was to bring her in front of Barnes & Nobles at 730. The actual proposal was a surprise to all. Everything was all setup for the big day.

							Sat, May 19 came and the anticipation I had was unbearable. I wish I had the click remote so I could fast forward the day and skip to the outcome at the end. I told her I needed to take my brother to the airport and would probably not see her when I got back. So I wished her a good time with the girls and headed out around 5. The proposal time was set at 730 so I figured I had a good amount of time to drive over to Chinatown to get the ring and then over to union square to setup. Oh how I underestimated NYC traffic... I barely made it to jewelry store before they closed and literally had to pull over to run to store. We then drove to union square and found a spot right away. By this time it was around 7pm so I figured I had a good 30 min to setup. But of course the girls were running late, I actually had a full hour to prepare. I originally wanted to do it in front of Barnes & Nobles but there was a cop standing out front. Then I figured it would be okay to setup across the street in the park where we wouldn't get harassed. As 8pm approached, the street got less crowded so I did not need to worry about a huge crowd. I finally got a text from the girls saying that they had parked and were walking over. I passed on the msg to my dancers and then we got into position..... to find out what happened next, please view video to the right >

							11 ½ years ago, Andy asked me out in front of Barnes & Nobles by Union Square Park on 2/20/2001. Never would I have thought that Andy was going to ask me to marry him a few days before my 30th birthday.  Lately, Andy and I have been discussing more about marriage, but decided that since we just bought a place and with so many of our friends getting engaged/married, we were going to hold off on discussing it further. Besides, our piggy bank needed to be replenished from buying our place. 
						</p>

							That day, Andy left our home earlier because he claimed he had to take his brother to the airport. My girlfriends had plans to take me out to dinner for my birthday celebration in the city. After we parked the car, we started walking towards Union Square Park. The girls decided to stop and watch the street performers break dance. I asked, “Aren’t we running late?” My friend, Jennifer said our girlfriends were running late and we had time. As we were watching the Bboys perform, I noticed they were break dancing to the song, “Marry you” sang by Glee (Yes, I’m a gleek and sorry Bruno Mars). I was thinking what an odd song to dance to and when I mentioned it to my friend Annie, she smiled and went back to recording the performers with her iPad. She just got her iPad recently, and she’s been carrying it around often. My friend, Lucy was also recording them with her iPhone. The only thought that came in my head was, these girls don’t get out much. I see talented street performers all the time in the city when I commute to work! Just then, I received a text message from my friend and as I texted back, my friend, Lucy nudged me and said, “Pay attention, they are really good.” So I did until the song ended. The performers then started calling out for donations and one of them was making his rounds carrying a bag. Annie asked me to donate for her when I was pulling out my wallet. As I dropped $2 in the bag, I looked up and saw Andy disguised as one of the break dancers!

							That same moment, I was shocked, confused, nervous since I realized he was going to propose. I just stupidly blurted out, “What the hell are you doing here?” Yes, I know that’s very romantic of me. I wish I can re-enact it all over again or even tell you all a different story, but unfortunately it was caught on video so there’s no way I can fib out of this one. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Andy then asked me if I remembered this place and said this was where he asked me out 11 ½ years ago and said no matter what, we will always be friends. He got down on one knee with a beautiful ring in his hand and asked me, “Will you marry me?” I teared and said “of course!” 
						</p>
						<p>
							I was completely thrown off and would never have thought that all the girls were going to be in on this and fell for the ruse completely. I really believed for awhile that I was going to get engaged after I turned 30 with our financial situation issue. After exchanging hugs with everyone, taking pictures and thanking the BBoys for their work (by the way, they are not street performers. However, they are talented guys who do this for a living), we had to head to the restaurant for dinner because we were really running late by then. 
						</p>
						<p>
							As we walked into the Wildwood BBQ restaurant, I was expecting to meet my three other girlfriends, but instead I saw my group of close friends. Friends who are like family to me and have known for the past 7-17 years were there on one of the happiest days of my life. At that moment, I felt truly blessed and thought Andy, my best friend and now fiancé really understands me. He knew that there’s nothing I love more than to have my adoring cousin, Lana and the HH Family there to celebrate my 30th birthday and our engagement together.
